## Profile

I am a driven software engineer and an open science/data/source supporter, living in Coimbra, Portugal.

I have been working remotely as a full-stack software engineer/tech lead since 2015, helping companies craft software that works. Besides programming, I like experimenting with technology stacks - mostly backend - mentoring and managing agile and pragmatic teams.

I also try to make time for pet projects focused on solving daily problems and general experimenting and learning.

Check out my [resume visualized on github](https://github.com/brecke/resume-visualized).

## Skills

I love building products no matter the technology I’m using, as long as it’s the right one for the job and open source. I have used several technologies and frameworks since 2006, including Ruby on Rails, Javascript (Node.js, React) and Elixir/Phoenix (more recently).

## Stands

- Work smarter, not harder
- Always compromise on scope, not craftsmanship
- The only way to go fast is to go well
- The broken windows effect is real
- Coffee over tea
