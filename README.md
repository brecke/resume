# Resumé

## Profile

I am an opinionated tech lead based in Coimbra, Portugal. I am passionate about the Web, technology and other Hackernews-related content. I am a FOSS supporter and evangelist, even though I use a macbook pro on a daily basis.

I am very eager to learn new things, be it the new framework on the block or agile practices (kanban is my favorite).

I strongly believe in working smarter, not harder.

## Skills

These days I’m more of a software architect than a developer. That means analysing and testing technology stacks (both frontend and backend), designing APIs and making a lot of decisions (and compromises).

Technically I have used the right tool for the job in most of my development projects, including Ruby on Rails, Python & Django, Java and Javascript. I love crafting products no matter the technology I’m using, as long as it’s the right one for the job and open source.

I also do some devops work and help maintaining internal services based on open source products. That includes project management tools, collaboration tools, chat rooms, versioning servers, etc. My virtual server templates are preferably debian based and come with vim and git installed as a default.

I try to make time for pet projects regularly for solving small daily problems and general experimenting and learning. Future personal assignments include playing with Redis and Node.
